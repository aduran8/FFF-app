There are other ways one can score points as well; through defense, or special teams plays that do not include field goals. The sport of American football varies only a little depending on the level that it is played;"

        "Once a team has achieved a first down after passing the opponent's 10 yard line, there is no opportunity to achieve a fresh set of downs. The term '1st & Goal' then comes into play. Followed by '2nd & Goal', and so forth. Usually, if a team is facing a '4th & Goal' situation, the team will elect to kick a field goal."

Normally, a player plays either offense or defense, it is uncommon for a specific player to play both sides of the ball.  There are a total of 11 players for all three sections of the game; any more than that results in a penalty to the team with 11 players.
